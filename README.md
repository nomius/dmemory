dmemory
=======

This library allows the user to work with memory in a more consistent way. (Educative project)

Normally unexperienced C programmers tend to produce memory leaks and data corruption. This library allows those programmers to create a file report informing about memory leaks and memory corruption, the file and line that produced those bugs.
